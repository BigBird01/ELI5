    "question": "How can different animals perceive different colors ? --T-- ",
    "data_value": "color_question",
    "human_answer": "Larger animals ( including humans ) have special cells in the back of their eyes called cone cells . Each type of cone cell reacts to a specific wavelength : that is , light whose color corresponds to a specific part of the rainbow . When the cell is hit by light with the right wavelength , it sends a signal to the brain , which combines information from all of the cone types to perceive the full color range . What colors each animal sees depends on the number of different cone types , and what wavelength they react to . For example , most humans have three cell types which perceive violet , green , and yellow , but some of us lack one of these types , leading to green - red color - blindness . Some species of bird or fish on the other hand have four different cell types , giving them a very different perception of colors .",
    "extractive_short": "Thus , saying that many animals can perceive color just means that they can distinguish different colors . Usually these are colors that are important to their survival . My reserach involves how we perceive colors in ' the real world ' . Under daily circumstances , we are not fooled by differences in changes in background color or under changes in illumination ( eg . How Trichromats Perceive Colors ?",
    "extractive_long": "But the logic behind the effects of colors on emotions is little different , as actually you do n\u2019t see colors but perceive wavelength of the electromagnetic waves . They have three receptor types , although unlike humans they are sensitive to ultraviolet light , with loss of sensitivity at the red end of the spectrum . All other animals , I had thought , have only brightness - detector cells \u2014 that is , rods \u2014 and , therefore , can not distinguish different colors . Color vision is the result of the brain integrating the responses of visual pigments , called rhodopsins , each responding to distinctly different wavelengths of light . Colors that have wavelengths that are either less or more than this visible spectrum are invisible to us .",
    "generative_short": "We do n't know for sure , but we do know that some animals have different color vision for different reasons . For example , some animals can see blue and green , while others can see red , while some animals ca n't . Some animals can also see rainbow colors , and some animals do n't .",
    "generative_long": "We do n't have the ability to perceive different colors . We have n't evolved to perceive the same colors as we do , but we have evolved to be able to see the things that we do . For example , if you have a cat that has a lot of color receptors , it 's likely that they have a lot more sensitive receptors than humans ."

  "flute_question": {
    "question": "Why are flutes classified as woodwinds when most of them are made out of metal ? --T-- ",
    "data_value": "flute_question",
    "human_answer": "Contrary to what the name suggests , the difference between woodwinds and brass instruments is about how the sound is produced rather than what material they are made of . By and large , brass instruments amplify or modify the sound produced by lips vibrating against each other , while woodwinds create their own sound when wind is directed through them . This can happen by vibrating a reed in the case of oboes or clarinets , or by vibrating the air column contained within a transverse flute or a recorder , which is why they are called woodwinds .",
    "extractive_short": "This is because the piccolo has a higher register , and metal piccolos can sound too piercing and therefore not blend well with other instruments . Musical instruments are usually classified as folk and professional instruments . They are all basically narrow cylinders or pipes , with holes , an opening at the bottom end and a mouthpiece at the top . The most common are metal , plastic , and wood . It is classified as being an aerophone .",
    "extractive_long": "Playing that first note is very difficult for a lot of people , and plenty of people never even get past that particular stage . The fine tuning is done by a small lever that is adjusted by a small thumb screw . The mouthpieces for some woodwinds , including the clarinet , oboe and bassoon , use a thin piece of wood called a reed , which vibrates when you blow across it . And it has been exasperatingly hard to find photos of the new mouthpieces . To play the flute you hold it sideways , set your lips as if you were about to whistle , and then blow across the air hole .",
    "generative_short": "The flutes are not made of brass . The flute is made from wood , and the rest of the woodwork is made from wood. The woodwork consists of two parts : the wood and the metal . Both parts are made in the same way , but the wood is made in a different way . For example , a woodwork clarinet and a woodwork flute are made of different woodwork parts , but both are made of woodwork . In the case of the flute , the parts are used together and not used in other parts .",

    "human_answer": "The exact beginning or end date of artistic periods that are taught in school are mostly arbitrary . Art historians usually try to use a major event or the creation of an art piece that features characteristics of the new period , or the death of a representative character . For example , the Baroque period is widely thought to start with the first representation of the first Baroque opera , l'Orfeo , in 1607 , and end with the death of its most famous composer , Johann Sebastian Bach , in 1750 . However , musical styles had actually started changing long before Bach passed away , and were already exhibiting features of what was to become known as the Classical period .

There are mammals that can swim to the island that are present , for example seals or whales . Over time , the ecological niche that mammals often occupy were filled by birds . Without traditional predators that often preyed on birds , the bird population grew and actually a lot of these birds were flightless . For the part about large birds --- I think because birds that were prey animals were getting larger , for example the Moa , the predators that ate them also got larger over time , for example the Haast eagle .",
